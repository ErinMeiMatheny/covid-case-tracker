# CovidData-Project

The goal of our project was to display live covid data in conjunction with the google maps API. We used chart.js to provide a visual representation of severity of case levels by drawing circles over respective countries when searched. This was done by calling lat/long data and confirmed case numbers from two separate APIs. 

Google maps is the centered feature on our site. To the left and below we also used chart.js to provide visual representations of (1) Top Ten Countries ranked by confirm case numbers (2) search results comparing deaths, recovered, and confirmed cases (3) a pie chart displaying global stats of total deaths, recovered, and confirmed cases. 

The site is responsive by design so that features are collapsed when displayed on a smaller screen. The Top Ten Countries feature is collapsed into a toggle bar that displays when clicked.

Features we want to work on moving forward include making the site fully interactive so that when a country is clicked, data will populate in the "search results" card and having a pop-up window displaying active cases over time with a line graph.
